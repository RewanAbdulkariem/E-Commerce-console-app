# E-Commerce Console App
This project is a simple Java console-based back-end system designed as a final project to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It simulates basic functionalities of an online store, including user registration, login, and order management.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **model**: Contains data classes like `User` and `Order`.
- **menu**: Handles user interactions through different menu screens.
- **service**: Provides core logic such as user registration and order handling.
- **context**: Maintains global application state, like the logged-in user.
- **app**: Entry point of the application (`Main` class).

## Learning Outcome

This project was created as part of a learning journey to master the core concepts of OOP in Java, including:

- Class design and encapsulation
- Object interactions
- Menu-driven command line apps
- Defensive programming
